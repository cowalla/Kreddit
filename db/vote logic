# each link/comment has upvotes and downvotes
# upvotes/downvotes are arrays of user_ids
# when a user tries to vote on a link, 
# see whether the user is a part of either list

# if they are in the upvotes list
# && they are trying to upvote, do nothing
# && they are trying to downvote, remove id from upvote list,
#   add it to the downvote list

# if they are in the downvotes list
# && they are trying to downvote, do nothing
# && they are trying to upvote, remove id from downvote list,
#   add it to the upvote list

# if they are in neither, add to the right list
